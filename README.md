# Description
We’re “remaking” the mobile game Neko Atsume (Cat Collector) as a website, where a user creates an account and can view their house, and as they collect in-game currency,  they can use it to adopt cats to fill the house by clicking on empty spaces in the house and choosing a cat to place there. Implemented via MERN stack.
